What should the developers or other staff at Theranos done when it became clear that the product they were promising to customers and consumers had significant problems (didn't work at all)?

At what point does "healthy" hyperbole in the service of marketing become dangerous?

How might the narrative of Theranos be different if Elizabeth Holmes were a man? Think about how she modeled herself after Steve Jobs and altered the register of her voice to be more masculine, and how the cultural/political climate might have made Elizabeth Holmes's story especially enticing.

-Big Tech: Modern Day Monopolies
-Zach Nager
-BE Mod4

2)Why I'm interested
-Follow stocks, news. Hear mostly about "big 4" and large tech componies.
  Their performance dictates market. We know they overstep privacy bounds but
  fines/punishments have no effect. Too big to break up/change? Often say to
  self "oh well, what can we do about it?"

3)Classic monopolies:
-Andrew Carnegie / US Steel
-John D. Rockefeller / Standard Oil
-AT&T
-maintained singular control over the supply of their respective commodities.
  Too much power is one hand. No market competition.
  Without free market competition, these companies effectively set the national price.
  *Prices high, production and innovation low(stagnate), no alternatives/choice/options

4)Modern big tech companies - monopolies?
  -Once at forefront of innovation, now don't fear competition and lack innovation?
    -examples:
      -anti-competitive android bundling by google
      -google dominance in online ad space
      -apple exclusivity deals with AT&T and not allowing 3rd party apps
        -drives up prices by limiting competition
      -others (amazon, facebook, uber)

  -Have huge power, market caps. But don't necessarily dominate market share

5)Not all bad. Pro's of monopolistic behavior
  -services usually free
  -help consumers obtain goods and services for less cost and with less friction
  -more supply of more things at lower cost

6)Do we need tech componies to be big to function? Shoudl they be broken up?

7)What questions should new devs ask/consider when looking at jobs/in careers

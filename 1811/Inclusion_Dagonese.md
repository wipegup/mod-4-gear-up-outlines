Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Finding the Edge: Defining Inclusion and Exclusion in Tech Spaces

Introduction of yourself: My name is April. I'm in backend Mod 4.

Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest? To me, determining the value of inclusivity is only the first step. The next important step is acknowledging that inclusivity is a complex goal, and that sometimes we can't always make the most inclusive choices.

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: ___________________________

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? This topic will deepen students' thinking about the importance of inclusion in tech, hopefully stretching them to consider ethical questions from new angles and lending greater awareness of how their choices affect the world around us.

How will this impact you as a developer? By lending greater awareness of how my choices affect the world around me.

Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 1. 2. 3.

Anything additional you are adding to your talk? _________________________

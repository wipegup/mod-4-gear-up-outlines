Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Knowledge and Values

Talking points for your presentation:  

Below is the script for my content, does not include introduction or bridge to questions

In early 19th century America, the beginnings of a movement of curricular reform grew within the academy. Colleges were starting to experiment with allowing students more choice in their course of study. Up to this point, study in universities centered around the “classical curriculum” which included studies in Greek, Latin, and, of course, the Bible.
 
It’s important to point out that colleges during this period functioned in a capacity similar to the high-schools today. First of all, a broad base of lower levels of education had yet to be meaningfully established. Additionally, a philosophy of the “the unity of truth” guided academic belief. A “unity of truth” meant that all knowledge, from physics to biblical exegesis, was believed to be reconcilable – All knowledge is part of a single whole.

 In response to the experiments in curriculum, mentioned earlier, the faculty in New Haven published The Yale Report of 1828. The Report strongly and effectively argued in favor of the classical curriculum – influencing colleges to stay the course – for a time.
 
OK, so that’s 1828.
 
1859 Darwin published On the Origin of Species.
Darwin’s work challenged “classical curriculum” on three levels – The scientific theory of evolution challenged biblical exegesis; The scientific method of the work offered the promise of unprecedented scientific progress and called into question other types of knowledge; and finally there was the philosophical system; can or even should the Bible form the basis for all knowledge. –- The “Unity of Truth” was clearly on shaky ground.

1862 The Morrill Land-Grant act was passed.
The Land-Grand act gave explicit provision and support for technical and practical education. Institutions not called Harvard and Yale started to grow and see success. 

Harvard and Yale had kind of anticipated this shift, starting science degrees in the 1840s that were parallel courses to the standard classical curriculum. However those science courses started out as explicitly second-rate courses. If you weren’t admitted to pursue a BA, the BS might be an option. 

By the end of the 19th century, alternate courses of study had become popular, and in an 1885 debate between the presidents of Harvard and Princeton, the arguments for an elective curriculum – where each student could choose their own course of study – won out over arguments for the classical curriculum.

The widespread adoption of the elective curriculum revitalized the academy bringing new monies, students and pressures not present in the days of Homer and Herodotus.
 
Ok great – science had gotten better, there was demand for practical (and more exciting) education – so what?

George Marsden’s book on this subject is entitled “The Soul of the American University: From Protestant Establishment to Established Nonbelief.” I believe this period of time is worth a second look as it is the crux of this shift of the “soul” from protestant establishment to established nonbelief. Shifts with tectonic implications about what is worth learning, and even what is true and what is right present themselves as mere additions and deletions from the course catalogue. The unending chase for money and students both marginalized and enhanced academic missions.

It is easy to take the state of the academy today as mostly reasonable and coherent. It is also easy to look back at 1801 and dismiss the state of the academy as anachronistic by today’s standards, but, to also see that for the time, it was mostly reasonable and coherent.

Colleges changed from religious institutions with singular focus teaching about the world to worldly institutions with fractures and divided focus that will, at times, teach about religions.

And doesn’t that feel a little odd. 

"Here at Turing, at the very least we implicitly value  vocational knowledge. Was this always the case for you growing up?

If not, when did that change?

2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:  
1. "Here at Turing, at the very least we implicitly value  vocational knowledge. Was this always the case for you growing up?  
2. If not, when did that change?  
3. Are there forms of knowledge which you implicitly value more or less? (Think about what you might use to support a variety of questions, spanning from the philosophical: ""What makes a valuable life?"" to the more concrete: ""How should we improve educational outcomes?)"
